                Born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, I started my journey
                working in hospitality. I did this for 10+ years across 2
                countries and several hotels and spas. I moved to Norway with my
                family to pursue a higher education in frontend Development.

                I am goal driven and solution orientated. Highly curious and a
                real team player. I currently speak 3 languages. 2 of which are
                fluent (English and Afrikaans) whilst the third is intermediate
                (Norwegian)
